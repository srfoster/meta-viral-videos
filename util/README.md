#Coding vs COVID-19

This is code I'm writing during COVID-19.
I'm releasing it for educational purposes -- to accompany my YouTube
series: "Coding vs COVID-19".

The world is full of software.  What it's lacking is software that successfully
tells its own backstory.

When most students encounter a real codebase for the first time, they
are typically unaware of its backstory -- or even that the backstory of a 
piece of software matters.  To make matters worse, most engineering teams do not keep
detailed records of a software's story to date.  A repository's commit
history is pretty much the state of the art in software storytelling.  

That falls short.  Much of the thinking and designing that goes into 
a software project gets lost along the way.  
Thus, the nooks, crannies, quirks, and oddities
of a software artifact are often mysteries to anyone who joins
the team when the software's story is "in medias res".    When the original
authors of that software artifact are no longer on board -- those mysteries
can become permanent. 

It's no surpirse then, that the "ramp up" time for new
developers is often long and arduous.

An understanding that stories matter, and that storytelling can 
improve the design of large pieces of software, can be transformative
for both novice developers and software architects.

At the end of the day, we're all coauthoring software together,
which means we're coauthoring stories that come true as the result of our
work.  The art of telling good stories ought to be central in software 
engineering education and our professional practice.

I long for the day when coding education becomes more about
learning and engaging with software stories -- rather than a 
laundry list of "coding concepts" and a sequence of lifeless 
"coding assignments" -- each disconnected from the last.
